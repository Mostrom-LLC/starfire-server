Based on the information from the **Starfire Co-Development Pitch** PDF, it would be smart to **update the prompts for your Visualization API** to better align with Starfire‚Äôs **commercial intelligence focus** and the **last-mile deliverables** they aim to automate.

Here‚Äôs a breakdown and suggested updates:

---

## üîë Key Takeaways from the Starfire Document Relevant to Prompt Design:

1. **Starfire‚Äôs Core Purpose:**

   * Help **pharma commercial teams** analyze disparate datasets and generate **actionable insights** (not just raw data).
   * Replace **static, consultant-driven reports** with **dynamic, real-time outputs** (including slides and scenario models).

2. **Types of Outputs Needed:**

   * Trend identification (e.g., dips in sales, channel performance)
   * Anomaly detection (off-forecast signals)
   * Strategic recommendations (next best action)
   * Visual deliverables: **executive-ready slides** summarizing key insights.

3. **Target Users:**

   * Commercial leadership (EVPs, Heads of Commercial, Corporate Development)
   * Need for concise, decision-focused outputs without technical deep dives.

## üìù Suggested Prompt Update for Visualization API:

### Old Prompt (example):

> "Generate a visualization for the provided data set."

### Improved Prompt Based on Starfire:

> "Analyze the retrieved market performance data and generate an executive-level visualization that highlights:
>
> * Key trends and anomalies (e.g., dips in sales by channel, payor type)
> * Strategic insights and next-best-action recommendations
> * High-level summaries suitable for C-suite decision-makers.
>
> The visualization should be concise, intuitive, and ready to be inserted into a PowerPoint presentation. Use plain language, avoid technical jargon, and emphasize business impact."
